AIRLOCALIZE

1. Requirements
	Matlab needs to be pre-installed, along with the following Matlab toolboxes:
	- Image Processing Toolbox
	- Optimization Toolbox

2. Installation
	- download the AIRLOCALIZE folder containing the code to your computer.
	- add the AIRLOCALIZE folder (including its subfolders) to Matlab's path: 
		On Matlab's Home tab, in the Environment section, click 'Set Path'. 
		Click 'Add with subfolders' and select the AIRLOCALIZE folder.
		(see https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_env/add-remove-or-reorder-folders-on-the-search-path.html)
	
2. Running AIRLOCALIZE
	- using the user interface: type in the Matlab command line AIRLOCALIZE(). 
	A series of pop-up windows will guide you through the steps required to set the parameters. 
	See the wiki for a more detailed how-to (https://github.com/timotheelionnet/AIRLOCALIZE/wiki)
	- using a config file: type in the Matlab command line AIRLOCALIZE('path/to/your/config/file').
	For instance, to analyze of the examples:
		- set Matlab's Current Folder to your AIRLOCALIZE folder. (if the current folder information is not displayed in the main window: on the Home tab, in the Environment section, click Layout. Then, in the Show section, select Current Folder.)
		- type in the command line: AIRLOCALIZE('examples/2DsmFISH_humCells.ini');
		- the analysis should start automatically.
